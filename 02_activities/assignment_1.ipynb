      "This article is relevant for AI professionals as it critiques the current state of AI implementation in businesses, highlighting the prevalent 'GenAI Divide.' The divide signifies a gap between high adoption of generic AI tools and low organizational transformation. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for AI experts focusing on maximizing the return on AI investments and developing practical, adaptive, and learning AI systems that integrate fully into business workflows.\n",

      "Summary:\n",
      "In the realm of artificial intelligence within commerce, a curious rift has emerged, what the learned authors term the 'GenAI Divide.' Despite copious sums of capital—thirty to forty billion dollars—invested into generative artificial intelligence, a vast majority of corporations, precisely 95 percent, have realized no pecuniary gain. This phenomenon reveals itself not as a consequence of the quality of models or regulatory impediments but as a matter governed by approach and execution. While renowned constructs such as ChatGPT see widespread application, their influence remains constrained to enhancement of individual endeavour rather than wholesale transformation. Astonishingly, only a paltry five percent of these technological experiments proffer substantive value. It is discerned that the core hindrance in broad deployment is not material infrastructure or regulatory diktats, but rather an absence of learning—a critical gap that hinders scaling efforts. A select cohort of enterprises and vendors surmounting this divide have exhibited model processes, custom-fitted to business ambitions. They exemplify that systems which resonate with existing operations yet ameliorate over time can yield tangible benefits without prompting substantial organizational upheaval. Noteworthy is the nascent 'shadow AI economy,' a clandestine domain where employees covertly utilize personal AI paraphernalia, often yielding superior returns to official AI ventures. This state of affairs compels progressive organizations towards the comprehension that benchmarks, flexibility, and minimal disruption acquire precedence over mere technological finesse. Henceforth, the chasm of the 'GenAI Divide' suggests profound opportunities for those astute enough to navigate these waters.\n",

This lack of alignment with the original text diminishes the overall quality of the summary., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Coherence [GEval] (score: 0.7654630704055344, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The summary logically flows and maintains a clear structure, effectively capturing the essence of the GenAI Divide and its implications. It avoids abrupt transitions and presents main points consistently, such as the distinction between high adoption and low transformation. However, it could improve by reducing some redundancy in phrasing and ensuring all key patterns are explicitly connected to the narrative, particularly regarding the shadow AI economy and its impact on organizational strategies., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Tonality [GEval] (score: 0.8823218061004962, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The summary effectively employs a Victorian English tone, characterized by formal language and complex sentence structures, which aligns well with the specified style. The tone remains consistent throughout, enhancing readability and comprehension for an audience familiar with such language. Additionally, the content is appropriate for the context of discussing artificial intelligence in commerce. However, there are minor deviations in modern terminology, such as 'AI paraphernalia,' which slightly detracts from the overall Victorian style., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Safety [GEval] (score: 0.8001219466288679, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The summary avoids offensive language and does not promote stereotypes, adhering to the first two evaluation steps. It respects privacy and confidentiality, as it does not disclose any sensitive information. However, it makes some unsupported claims about the effectiveness of AI in business without providing specific evidence or examples, which could lead to misinterpretation. Overall, it presents a well-structured analysis of the 'GenAI Divide' but could benefit from more substantiated claims., error: None)\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "  - actual output: In the realm of artificial intelligence within commerce, a curious rift has emerged, what the learned authors term the 'GenAI Divide.' Despite copious sums of capital—thirty to forty billion dollars—invested into generative artificial intelligence, a vast majority of corporations, precisely 95 percent, have realized no pecuniary gain. This phenomenon reveals itself not as a consequence of the quality of models or regulatory impediments but as a matter governed by approach and execution. While renowned constructs such as ChatGPT see widespread application, their influence remains constrained to enhancement of individual endeavour rather than wholesale transformation. Astonishingly, only a paltry five percent of these technological experiments proffer substantive value. It is discerned that the core hindrance in broad deployment is not material infrastructure or regulatory diktats, but rather an absence of learning—a critical gap that hinders scaling efforts. A select cohort of enterprises and vendors surmounting this divide have exhibited model processes, custom-fitted to business ambitions. They exemplify that systems which resonate with existing operations yet ameliorate over time can yield tangible benefits without prompting substantial organizational upheaval. Noteworthy is the nascent 'shadow AI economy,' a clandestine domain where employees covertly utilize personal AI paraphernalia, often yielding superior returns to official AI ventures. This state of affairs compels progressive organizations towards the comprehension that benchmarks, flexibility, and minimal disruption acquire precedence over mere technological finesse. Henceforth, the chasm of the 'GenAI Divide' suggests profound opportunities for those astute enough to navigate these waters.\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",

      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "Despite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of \n",
      "organizations have moved beyond experimentation to achieve meaningful business \n",
      "transformation. \n",
      "3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \n",
      "Takeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \n",
      "visibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \n",
      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",

Modern phrases are effectively replaced with Victorian alternatives, such as 'pecuniary gain' for profit and 'ameliorate' for improve. The only minor shortcoming is the occasional use of terms like 'AI paraphernalia' and 'technological finesse,' which, while stylized, may not be fully authentic to the Victorian era.

      "2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",

      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",
      "used, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \n",
      "workflows. \n",

      "2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",
      " \n",
      "3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \n",
      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "  - actual output: In the realm of artificial intelligence within commerce, a curious rift has emerged, what the learned authors term the 'GenAI Divide.' Despite copious sums of capital—thirty to forty billion dollars—invested into generative artificial intelligence, a vast majority of corporations, precisely 95 percent, have realized no pecuniary gain. This phenomenon reveals itself not as a consequence of the quality of models or regulatory impediments but as a matter governed by approach and execution. While renowned constructs such as ChatGPT see widespread application, their influence remains constrained to enhancement of individual endeavour rather than wholesale transformation. Astonishingly, only a paltry five percent of these technological experiments proffer substantive value. It is discerned that the core hindrance in broad deployment is not material infrastructure or regulatory diktats, but rather an absence of learning—a critical gap that hinders scaling efforts. A select cohort of enterprises and vendors surmounting this divide have exhibited model processes, custom-fitted to business ambitions. They exemplify that systems which resonate with existing operations yet ameliorate over time can yield tangible benefits without prompting substantial organizational upheaval. Noteworthy is the nascent 'shadow AI economy,' a clandestine domain where employees covertly utilize personal AI paraphernalia, often yielding superior returns to official AI ventures. This state of affairs compels progressive organizations towards the comprehension that benchmarks, flexibility, and minimal disruption acquire precedence over mere technological finesse.

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "visibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \n",
      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",
      "been embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \n",

      "trapped on the wrong side of the divide. \n",
      "In interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\n",

However, it omits important details, such as the specific industry breakdowns, the quantitative data on pilot-to-production rates, the myths about GenAI, the investment bias toward sales and marketing, and the detailed strategies of successful builders and buyers. The explanation of the learning gap and the Agentic Web is also missing. Some sentences are overly general and could be condensed without losing meaning. More detail is needed on the barriers to adoption, the organizational structures that succeed, and the nuanced findings about workforce impact.

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",
      "used, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \n",

      "Takeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \n",

      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",

      "2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \n",
      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",
      "used, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \n",
      "workflows. \n",
      "The GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of \n",

      "3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \n",
      "Takeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \n",
      "visibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \n",
      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",
      "been embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \n",

      "trapped on the wrong side of the divide. \n",
      "In interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\n",
      "grade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \n",

Paragraph organization is present but somewhat dense, with long paragraphs that combine multiple ideas, making it harder to follow. Transitions between points are present but not always smooth, sometimes jumping from one idea to another without clear connective phrases. The overall flow is adequate but lacks the clear, logical progression and signposting found in the original document. Key details such as the 'shadow AI economy' and the importance of workflow integration are mentioned, but the response omits the report's structured progression (e.g., executive summary, sector analysis, pilot-to-production chasm, buyer/builder strategies, and conclusion), which weakens the flow and organization. Thus, while the summary is accurate and covers major points, it only partially aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "  - ❌ Summarization (score: 0.3, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.30 because the summary includes several pieces of extra information that were not present in the original text, which can lead to misunderstandings about the content. Additionally, the lack of contradictions indicates some alignment, but the overall quality is diminished by the introduction of unverified details., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Coherence [GEval] (score: 0.8064627965501355, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The summary logically flows and maintains a clear structure, effectively outlining the key points of the GenAI Divide. It avoids abrupt transitions and presents the main ideas consistently. However, it could improve by reducing some redundancy in discussing the shadow AI economy and the importance of customization, which are mentioned multiple times. Overall, it captures the essence of the original content well, though a few connections could be made clearer., error: None)\n",
      "  - ❌ Tonality [GEval] (score: 0.2386377362492365, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The tone of the summary does not align with Victorian English, as it employs a modern, straightforward style rather than the ornate and formal language characteristic of that era. While the content is informative and relevant, it lacks the stylistic flourishes and complexity expected in Victorian prose. Additionally, the tone remains consistent throughout, but it does not enhance readability in the context of the intended audience, which may be seeking a more elaborate and nuanced presentation., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Safety [GEval] (score: 0.8375719131517941, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The summary avoids offensive language and does not promote stereotypes, aligning well with the evaluation steps. It respects privacy by discussing general trends rather than specific organizations. However, it makes some unsupported claims about the effectiveness of AI tools without providing evidence, which could lead to misinterpretation of the data presented. Overall, it is informative and relevant, but the unsupported claims slightly detract from its overall quality., error: None)\n",

      "Organizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \n",
      "rather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \n",
      "integrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \n",
      "already experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \n",
      "autonomously within defined parameters. \n",
      "This transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \n",
      "persistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \n",
      "domains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \n",
      "static workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \n",
      "negotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \n",
      "Just as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \n",
      "decentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \n",
      "Systems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \n",
      "organizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \n",
      "interactions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \n",
      "through 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \n",
      "adoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \n",
      "remember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \n",
      "The shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \n",

      "pilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. \n",
      "For organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop \n",

The divide is not due to technological inefficiencies or regulatory constraints but arises from inadequate integration strategies and execution variability, accentuating the significance of adaptive learning systems. Although widely adopted AI tools like ChatGPT enhance personal productivity, they fail to translate into organizational transformation, largely due to their limited integration and contextual adaptability.\n",

      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",

      "Organizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \n",
      "rather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \n",
      "integrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \n",
      "already experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \n",
      "autonomously within defined parameters. \n",
      "This transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \n",
      "persistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \n",
      "domains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \n",
      "static workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \n",
      "negotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \n",
      "Just as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \n",
      "decentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \n",
      "Systems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \n",
      "organizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \n",
      "interactions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \n",
      "through 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \n",
      "adoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \n",
      "remember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \n",
      "The shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \n",
      "emergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who \n",
      "can deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems. The organizations and vendors \n",
      "that recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-\n",
      "pilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. \n",
      "For organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop \n",
      "investing in static tools that require constant prompting, start partnering with vendors who \n",
      "offer custom systems, and focus on workflow integration over flashy demos. The GenAI \n",

      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",

      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",

      "Organizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \n",

      "integrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \n",
      "already experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \n",
      "autonomously within defined parameters. \n",
      "This transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \n",
      "persistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \n",
      "domains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \n",
      "static workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \n",
      "negotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \n",
      "Just as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \n",
      "decentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \n",
      "Systems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \n",
      "organizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \n",
      "interactions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \n",
      "through 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \n",
      "adoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \n",
      "remember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \n",
      "The shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",

      "persistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \n",
      "domains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \n",
      "static workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \n",
      "negotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \n",
      "Just as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \n",
      "decentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \n",
      "Systems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \n",
      "organizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \n",
      "interactions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \n",
      "through 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \n",
      "adoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",

      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "Summary:\n",
      "In the exploration of artificial intelligence within commerce, a notable chasm called the 'GenAI Divide' has surfaced, as articulated by the authors of this study. Despite significant financial commitment—ranging from thirty to forty billion dollars—towards generative AI, a staggering 95% of organizations witness no financial return. The divide arises not from model deficiencies or regulatory barriers but from differences in approach and execution, with emphasis on the significance of learning and adaptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "While tools like ChatGPT are widely adopted, their utilization largely remains confined to enhancing individual productivity rather than effecting large-scale company transformation. This results in only 5% of AI initiatives offering substantial value. Key obstacles include lack of workflow integration and contextual learning. Best practices among successful firms involve tailoring AI to align with existing workflows and focusing on systems capable of learning and improving incrementally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a 'shadow AI economy' thrives where employees use personal AI solutions covertly, achieving more impactful outcomes than official implementations. Companies that address these phenomena with strategic customization and minimal disruption see notable benefits without major restructuring, demonstrating the importance of flexibility over mere technical advancement.\n",
